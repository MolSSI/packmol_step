    Will create a cubic region containing the following molecules:

        +-------------+------------------+---------+
        |  Component  | Structure        |   Ratio |
        |-------------+------------------+---------|
        |   solute    | c1ccccc1c2ccccc2 |         |
        |    fluid    | O                |       1 |
        +-------------+------------------+---------+

    The dimensions of the region will be calculated from the solute dimensions.
    If the input structure is periodic, its dimensions will be used. Otherwise
    for molecules, a the region will be a box with extra space of 10.0 Å around
    the molecule. The number of molecules of the fluid will be obtained by
    rounding 100 molecules to give the requested ratios of species.

Created a periodic cubic cell 18.47 Å on a side with the solute and 202 solvent molecules

    +-------------+------------------+----------+
    |  Component  | Structure        |   Number |
    |-------------+------------------+----------|
    |   solute    | c1ccccc1c2ccccc2 |        1 |
    |    fluid    | O                |      202 |
    +-------------+------------------+----------+

There are a total of 628 atoms in the cell giving a density of 0.9993 g/ml.
