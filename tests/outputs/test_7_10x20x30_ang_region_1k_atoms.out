    Will create a rectangular region containing the following molecules:

        +-------------+------------------+---------+
        |  Component  | Structure        |   Ratio |
        |-------------+------------------+---------|
        |    fluid    | c1ccccc1c2ccccc2 |       1 |
        |    fluid    | O                |      50 |
        +-------------+------------------+---------+

    The dimensions of the region will be given explicitly by the three sides
    10.0 Å x20.0 Å x30.0 Å. The number of molecules of the fluid will be
    obtained by rounding 1000 atoms to give a whole number of molecules with the
    requested ratios.

Created a rectangular 10.00 x 20.00 x 30.00 Å region with 306 fluid molecules

    +-------------+------------------+----------+
    |  Component  | Structure        |   Number |
    |-------------+------------------+----------|
    |    fluid    | c1ccccc1c2ccccc2 |        6 |
    |    fluid    | O                |      300 |
    +-------------+------------------+----------+

There are a total of 1032 atoms in the cell giving a density of 1.7518 g/ml.
